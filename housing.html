              <p>After release, previously incarcerated individuals often come out with little more than what they came in with. Any money that they previously had was most likely spent on heavily overpriced commissary essentials while they were serving their sentence. Many of these offenders do not have a place to go after this. Often times, their sentence will even restrict them from moving back in with a family member. While there are government-sponsored programs and public housing programs available, not everyone who is released is eligible.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title text-left mb-3">An Address is Everything</h5>
              <p>By providing a home, even temporarily, to those in need, they are able to not only have the peace of mind of not having to sleep on the streets, but it also provides them with an address. This is important because most job applications require a current, valid address to be listed on the form. Without this, seeking employment becomes nearly impossible. </p>
