                      <p class="card-text text-left">In the United States, a variety of crimes, violent and non-violent, can result in an individual facing a felony charge. Regardless of the nature of the crime, having a felony on your record appears as a red flag to both employers and those reviewing housing applications. Without income and housing, society has structurally created a system in which felons are further punished, even after serving their time behind bars and, in turn, puts them at a disadvantage to properly reintegrate into society. Barring these individuals from basic needs required to thrive in this country solely based on mistakes that they have already served time for is wholly unjust in “the land of opportunity”.</p>

                      <p class="card-text text-left ">We as a nation should push for more funding to be spent on assistance programs to provide safe housing for those who are in danger of homelessness, as well as implement policies in hiring processes that prevents employers from turning down eligible applicants, solely based on the fact that they have previously been incarcerated. By doing so, we will see a drop in recidivism, thus making our communities an all-around safer place. </p>
